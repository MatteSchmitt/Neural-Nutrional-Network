# Neural-Nutrional-Network
This project is based on using deep learning neural networks for food image classification. By training the model on various food images, from whole to processed items. Another goal of this project is to enable nutritional analysis based on the image classification results, providing insights about the dietary content of the identified food items.


Model was too large to upload so you will have to use the code to generate one.
